# Udden Artgallery

## About

This is a website for a nonexisting artgallery placed at Blockhusudden in Djurgården, Stockholm. 

Udden Artgallery exhibits mostly modern contemporary art and photographs. It's thought to be funded through a fund, state contribution aswell as entry fees. Since not being entirelly reliant on It's visitors in the economic aspect Udden is granted partly the freedom of not having to be too commercial whilst gaining a greater responsibility towards It's donors. In conclusion this creates a dubble responsibility for Udden, that also has to be applied to the website. One being commercial and the other to make sure to follow it's contributors wishes, this to guarantee further economical grants. 



## UX

## Strategy

The goal of the website is for potential visitors to, in an intuitive way understand the focus on the gallery while still being informative aswell as accessible. 
Since the gallery hosts artworks made by modern artists the approach in colourschemes, fonts and images is according to the common subconcious view of the concept of modern art and galleries. 

#### Accessibility 
By setting the fontsize of the paragraphs to 1rem, the font is both responsive aswell as on the larger scale. 

#### User Stories

* Visitors of Djurgården, Stockholm 
* People interested in art 
* Artists
* Tourists 

#### Reasons for the website

* Attracting visitors
* Informing potential visitors about opening hours, pricing etc. 
* A way for artists and visitors to get in touch with the gallery

## Scope 
#### What the user may expect
* As a user I would expect the website to be easily navigated with the information clearly rendered and for it to render well across devices.

* The design of the website should be in line with what is expected for a gallery of modern or contemporary art. 

#### What the user may want
* To be able to find out which exhibitions that are currently shown with images and description.
* To be able to contact the gallery
* To be able to find out more about the gallery
* Social media Icons
* Locate the address, opening hours and pricing of the gallery

#### Addressing user needs and expectencies 
To address the former needs stated the website will have:
* A working navbar
* A "contact us" form
* Easy access to address, pricing and opening hours 
* Social Icons
* Mobile-first approach in creating the website

## Structure

(Assuming some part of the websites visitors would be people tired from walking at Djurgården I wanted the header of the website to have a feeling of calm, as in, a place to rest aswell as maintaining the attention of the visitor. To achive this i used a image (credited below)  with a background of blue background aswell as a animation, "keyframe" (also credited below) to have the viewer "sunk in".)
 
#### Colors

* Using colors that are complementary aswell as monochromatic colors to enhance user experience. 

* Using the ColorPick Eyedropper tool extension for Google Chrome to use colors viewed in the header as footer.  

#### Fonts





## Bugs Discovered

* The header doesn't render well in mobile format. The navbar and logo becomes smushed together and the informative div on the right completely dissapears.

* The Modal form didn't close when pressing the submit button. Solved by adding the bootstrap: data-dismiss="modal" attribute after searching on w3schools. 

* When rendered in mobile format the Google Map is too big. Not solved yet.
