# Udden Artgallery

This is a website for a nonexisting artgallery placed at Blockhusudden in Djurgården, Stockholm. 

## UX

The goal of the website is for potential visitors to, in an intuitive way understand the focus on the gallery while still being informative aswell as accessible. 
Since the gallery hosts artworks made by modern artists the approach in colourschemes, fonts and images is according to the common subconcious view of the concept of modern art and galleries. 

###Accessibility 
By increasing the font-size of the paragraphs 

### User Stories

* Visitors of Djurgården, Stockholm 
* People interested in art 
* Artists
* Tourists 

Assuming some part of the websites visitors would be people tired from walking at Djurgården I wanted the header of the website to have a feeling of calm, as in, a place to rest aswell as maintaining the attention of the visitor. To achive this i used a image (credited below)  with a background of blue background aswell as a animation, "keyframe" (also credited below) to have the viewer "sunk in". 


## Bugs Discovered

* The header doesn't render well in mobile format. The navbar and logo becomes smushed together and the informative div on the right completely dissapears.

* The Modal form didn't close when pressing the submit button. Solved by adding the bootstrap: data-dismiss="modal" attribute after searching on w3schools. 

* When rendered in mobile format the Google Map is too big. Not solved yet.
